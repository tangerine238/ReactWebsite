Our forward screening fleet has been scattered by enemy forces and is under attack. The enemy is using advanced signal jammers to disrupt comms and move undetected. Worse still, our supplies are limited, so you must be both efficient and effective with your equipment usage. We’ve approved use of our recon facilities, as well as our turrets if need be.
